Polystrip is a 2D hardware-accelerated rendering library, primarily targeted at game development, but which could
probably be used in other applications as well. Polystrip intends to be an abstraction layer over `wgpu` allowing for simple
yet flexible rendering in 2 dimensions.

**This crate should not be considered stable.** This crate will ~~likely~~ definitely make breaking changes between minor
versions at this stage.
